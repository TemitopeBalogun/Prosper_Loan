>Prosper is a US based lending marketplace, with over $21 billion in funded loans. Prosper generates revenue by collecting a one-time fee on funded loans from borrowers and assessing an annual loan servicing fee to investors. Borrowers can apply online which makes the process seamless. This dataset consists of 113,937 loans.

>In Wrangling phase, 13 columns were assessed which were narrowed down from 81 columns provided in the dataset(Initial Dataset is still available for use).
I discovered several null values in various colums which were dropped. There were outliers in Monthly Income and Prosper Score colums.


## Summary of Findings
